To answer your question, no,<br>
I don’t think I’d like you to say anything<br>
at the funeral for my male body.<br>
<br>
I don’t want you to bring up<br>
how fast that small animal used to run<br>
papercut fingers digging in the dirt for dandelions<br>
as the other boy scouts swarmed like flies.<br>
<br>
No need to mention a teenager sobbing empty in the school bathroom<br>
hands rubbed raw over acetone-stained sink<br>
pink polish scrubbed from each pale fingernail.<br>
No reason to dwell on the hours clutching <br>
rusty tweezers, plucking out leg hair one by one.<br>
Blood vessels bursting at each pinprick of pain.<br>
Strawberry skin, pockmarked thighs,<br>
ten thousand mosquito bites.<br>
<br>
Please don’t mention his betrayal<br>
in that girlfriend’s bedroom.<br>
Pinned down, lips frozen, <br>
that animal moaned guiltless, guttural, <br>
cried out in pain without knowing the reason why.<br>
<br>
It was years ago that I decided:<br>
this body was better off split in two. <br>
<br>
So, nowadays, cold metal.<br>
A needle introduces us, myself and the girl inside me. <br>
She guides my fingertips to my eyes; we dry our tears.<br>
<br>
I feel her molecule find her home in the small of my back.<br>
I acquaint myself with sore breasts, nausea, the stares from strangers. <br>
I drain myself, bloodletting my first puberty through my upper arm.<br>
I dirty my hands—they pierce deep in my swollen chest.<br>
I dig through each bloody lung and scoop out stale air. <br>
<br>
To answer your question, no, <br>
in fact, there’s no need to have the funeral.<br>
Because a dead boy who can still bleed<br>
isn’t really dead at all.<br>
