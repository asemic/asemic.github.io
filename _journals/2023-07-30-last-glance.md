hold still, release.<br> 
<br>
a sixtieth of a second is all i’d need for the shutter to fall,<br>
for your image to be held still & glorious in my unfed eyes.<br>
<br>
but, as always, you’re startled by the shutter’s sound.<br>
before i can apologize, you’ve taken flight,<br>
scattering black tattered feathers into the empty sky.<br>
<br>
should we try again? hold still, release—<br>
‘i’m no hunter,’ i whisper, yet you’re flying like the hunted,<br>
crying of triumph or terror,<br>
diving from crowns of mountains<br>
as if heaven-sent.<br>
<br>
hold still, i say, as if it could ever be my place to tell you<br>
when to stay and when to leave,<br>
where to lay your head to rest,<br>
which empty spaces to fill with your song.<br>
<br>
finger on the film advance, i lie <br>
in wait for you to turn around.<br>
show me your face;<br>
is it still the one i can trace with my finger<br>
in the fogged-up bathroom mirror?<br>
<br>
hold still—show me your hair;<br>
have you dyed it brown yet,<br>
or are silver strands of hair<br>
on someone else’s crumpled bedsheets?<br>
<br>
hold still—tilt your head;<br>
have the bruises on your neck already faded?<br>
<br>
hold still, release—hold<br>
hands with me, and i’ll show you to the darkroom.<br>
you know i can’t do much just watching you—but here,<br>
i can make a runaway train into your statue,<br>
a sudden rainstorm into your monument,<br>
a sixtieth of a second into your lifetime.<br>
<br>
hold still, just once,<br>
and i’ll give you all the time you need to dry your hair.<br>
<br>
hold still, release—once more, just<br>
<br>
hold still—<br>
<br>
stay where i can see you—<br>
