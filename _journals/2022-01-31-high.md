They thought me repulsive. I was repulsive.

I had two dreams last night. In the first I was in a crowd of people at a music festival losing myself, losing sight of everything yet swaying endlessly with the colors and the sound of the music. I coughed. The people behind me turned. They thought I had covid. The people behind me began backing away slowly, mortified. They were disgusted. In complete shock that something so digusting had invaded their space. I had ruined it all and the music stopped. I pleaded. "Wait, no, please don't leave, please, please, I'm not sick, I'm not sick" yet they began running, trampling across the grass desperately to get away from me, the sick, the disgusting, the diseased, the abandoned.

In the second I was sprinting towards the sunset with my camera in hand. The colors were beautiful, orange, pink, red, purple, blue. I could barely see beyond the blurs of color, my legs were giving out, my eyes nearly blinded, my heart pumping over and over and then suddenly I felt a great tumbling, and I was in a hospital bed. My father told me I would never be able to raise my heart rate again or my weakened diseased heart would give up and die. Bedridden, useless. A futile body

I have an unhealthy relationship with weed in that in the first 3-4 hours, it feels great, I'm vibing to music, sometimes I nut, sometimes I sing along, sometimes I laugh at funny tiktoks. But after that is when a haze begins to grow within me, a tumorous black hole opening up in my brain, and I make eye contact with the devil. It is only after a glimpse of the devil that you start to understand heaven; it is only after a glimpse of God that you begin to understand hell. He/it/whatever convinces me that this is the end. I stumble around my room staring into mirrors saying to myself "this isn't real, this isn't real," notifications from invisible people fill up my phone, I can't look at it but I do, I try to adjust the lights, eat something, wear a different blanket, turn on the fan, but I feel like I want to burst out of my own skin, it scares me, I lose grip, I get it back, the waves take me away, and I suffer. I suffer. I never get to sleep.

I was so scared

I couldn't breathe

I need to stop getting high
