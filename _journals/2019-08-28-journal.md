Thursday -- I'm, uh, with Syl. We're high. Everything is a blur and my head keeps fixating on small things that fly past my brain like arrows. The chemical structure of cyclopropane is on the ceiling. Sylvia's hand traces circles on my back. I'm kind of dizzy and sometimes it feels unpleasant but it always passes, one feeling giving way to another, and Sylvia is there the whole time, warm and close and beating.
Friday -- I'm in Helen's apartment to celebrate her birthday and there's a cat underneath the bed. My body feels exhausted and warm from walking so much and meeting so many new people and eating too much food. I lie facedown on the floor and coax the cat out from underneath the bed, and wonder when I can use the bathroom.
Saturday -- 
Sunday -- I'm walking back to Beth's apartment to finish planning the Tinikling choreography. Progress is slow. We choreograph 10 seconds of the dance for every five hours we work. My umbrella keeps getting blown away and the puddles seep into my socks. I wish we could finish so I can go home.
Monday -- I run around a lot
Tuesday -- Sylvia is crying
Wednesday -- I'm here

I don't think I'm good at in-class writing assignments.
