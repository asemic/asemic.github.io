I used to write a lot, you know.
There is this one piece (that I suppose I wrote a year ago) inspired by a painting (I forgot what it's called but there is a form of writing that is a reflection on art in another medium), about a gentle masculine musician, unsullied by aging, glowing in his youth, who arouses an instinct to protect. I'm kind of proud of it. 
But I've kind of lost the taste for writing, for one reason or another. My preferred stimuli have become visual and I've been trying (but failing) to renew my love for words, whether writing or reading them. Instead I focus on light, sound, the vibrations and waves that reach our ears rather than the words which pierce our minds. I order LED lights, sunset lamps. I invest in headphones and speakers. I make countless playlists and hop around genre incessantly and obsessively. I love pink and orange; the look of the sunset. I love moody landscape photos and the permanence of inscribing image onto film. I take pictures and wander aimlessly. I wish to lose myself in color, in it all
