think im losin it

things slippin away

I dunno if I ever really got a grip this semester; all I did was follow where my first instinct took me

I don't think it's possible for me to make, like, concrete decisions about anything. The responsibility is too much. I am paralyzed by anxiety and choice

And so back into my bed / sylvia's bed / sylvia's arms I go because that is where things are the simplest. It's me and her. Two certainties, zero unknowns

But every so often I get a shot of clarity that pierces through my head; it's like a splash of cold water to the face. Is this really what you wanted? it asks. Aren't you forgetting something?

aren't you forgetting something?
