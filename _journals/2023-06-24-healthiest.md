On the evening of the seventh day,<br>
god reaches his calloused hands into the garden of Eden,<br>
and, almost as an afterthought,<br>
fashions himself a man out of the red sand.<br>
<br>
Six thousand years later, he reaches inside my mother, <br>
and repeats the same motions in her womb.<br>
<br>
Dusty, dry. My body washes up on the shore.<br>
In catholic school they tell me what to do with it.<br>
“It’s a temple,” they say. “Your body’s a temple,”<br>
so that evening I try and touch myself, and <i>oh—</i><br>
<i>oh. Right. This again. </i>There it is—expecting warmth,<br>
I find nothing but bone-cold walls, and suddenly<br>
I am hurting in two places at once.<br>
<br>
It was god who molded my eyeballs out of pearls, <br>
but me who carved the bags underneath.<br>
<br>
It was god who fastened my muscles to my bones, <br>
but me who tore the threads apart.<br>
<br>
It was god who poured acid into my stomach, <br>
but me who tried to purge it out, <i>but I’m trying </i><br>
<i>to be better</i>, I am, I promised, I promised<br>
my mother I’d take care of myself, <i>no I haven’t eaten yet</i>, but<br>
I promise, I will, I’ll make this body a place I can finally live in.<br>
<br>
Today I will eat. I will light a candle in this temple<br>
that I forgot was a temple.<br>
<br>
Today I will sleep. Listening quietly I will be able<br>
to hear my organs sing.<br>
<br>
Today I will drink. I will kneel before my stained glass skin,<br>
leave my offering at the altar of my optic nerve.<br>
<br>
And at the end of it all, when I open my eyes to meet god’s gaze,<br>
I will see no one but myself, standing tall and proud in the garden of Eden.<br>
