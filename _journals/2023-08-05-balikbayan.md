all of the oceans were once one.<br>
your tears were once a Philippine typhoon,<br>
water that suffocated nurseries and cemeteries alike,<br>
a torrent trying desperately to reclaim<br>
eight thousand islands<br>
back to her hands.<br>
<br>
the waterfalls in our country — your country — roar <br>
in a language you never taught me.<br>
and yet, that salt water still squeezes through my veins,<br>
locked behind my aching ribcage<br>
where my heart beats faster and faster still.<br>
<br>
all of the oceans were once one,<br>
and my water was once yours,<br>
but i struggle to reconcile the frigid lake i nearly drowned myself in<br>
with the warm broth on our dinner table, poured onto steaming white rice.<br>
<br>
when drowned bodies are pulled ashore they are indistinguishable from any old corpse,<br>
recognizable only by loved ones,<br>
the beloved ones who have memorized <br>
every crease, every fold that once held the body together.<br>
<br>
often it is the mother who is called in to identify the body.<br>
<br>
we make it her job to see behind <br>
swollen skin<br>
decomposed cells<br>
atrophied limbs<br>
bruised body, abused body<br>
peel back the flesh to find the fruit of her womb.<br>
<br>
<i>how would my body look during the autopsy?</i> i wonder.<br>
i imagine my spent body on an operating table.<br>
i imagine the doctors cutting open the body created by you <br>
(and mutilated by me),<br>
(<i>is this a boy or a girl?</i> they ask),<br>
and i want to ask them, <i>what secrets have you found?</i><br>
<i>did you see something i didn't?</i><br>
<br>
maybe blood is still flowing through my heart's burst chambers,<br>
grains of salty sand behind the whites of my eyes,<br>
a ocean churning in my ophthalmic vein,<br>
a continental shelf lodged beneath my fingernails.<br>
<br>
it’s hard to imagine they’d find anything that you don't already know. <br>
<br>
please, mother, take me home after the autopsy.<br>
take me back in, dry me off,<br>
say grace over my body,<br>
take me back before the times when white priests spilled water on our bodies and called us catholic,<br>
before the great oceans splintered your country — our country — into eight thousand pieces.<br>
<br>
please, take me back, to the waters of your womb,<br>
to the pitch-black amniotic sac where i was neither boy nor girl,<br>
son nor daughter,<br>
didn't know inside from outside,<br>
when your blood was mine, and my body was yours.<br>
<br>
please, take me back,<br>
before the ocean opened between you and i<br>
before rivers ran from your cheeks as you held me <br>
and begged me not to drown myself.<br>
<br>
please, take me back,<br>
and this time i won't make you cry so often,<br>
i will wash off well, <br>
we will water the flowers,<br>
and we will learn to swim.<br>
<br>
