i don’t know why i was born a boy. it feels like someone made a big mistake at the beginning of my life. someone made a typo and put an M on my birth certificate instead of an F and some scientist accidentally dumped a pile of y chromosomes on my cells and made me grow up like this instead. i keep thinking how different it would have been. it would have been so different. i would have been flighty and free. i would have spun around as a kid and picked flowers without getting made fun of. i would have loved dresses, and skirts, and those online Flash games where u dress up your character with crop tops and hairstyles. i wouldn’t be very good at makeup at first but my mom would have taught me. she would have taught me really well.

i would have sung, so much! i would embarrass myself hitting the high notes but i bet my voice would have been beautiful. i would have written songs and recorded myself singing them while playing the piano. then i would’ve deleted all the recordings in embarrassment.

in middle school my hair would have been so long. then in high school i would’ve probably shaved it all off. and in college i would love it again and let it grow back. 

i think i would have cried just as much as i do now, for sad kdramas and anime scenes, for girls and sometimes boys, for poems and sunsets and songs. i would have had an embarrassing tumblr phase. i would’ve written bad poetry. i think i would have been self conscious for a while before realizing i was really really pretty.






it would have been so different. i think i would have loved so gently and so kindly. 8 think i would have tried really hard to make my parents proud of their daughter. i think i would have been happy to grow old and begin to look like my mom. i think i would’ve made a good kind mother. and i think i would have been named sunny, and my name would have always reminded me of warmth and light and love. it would have been so different. 






i’m sorry sunny but i can’t bring you into this life. i hope we can meet in the next one. i love you.
